With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, *co-occurrence matrices* (for more information, see [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/vectorsemantics.video.pdf) or [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285))."

Here\u0027s a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words.

If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as *[Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD)* — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively."
